## What's about?
**presentl** is an HTML5 template to be used as a presentation app for your projects.
The idea is to divide the presentation/project into cards.
The cards, when clicked, redirect to individual pages inside the app.

This project uses Tailwind.css as a frontend base. 

## How to use it
Clone the repository in your machine or simple download the files.
Use you default web browser to launch `index.html`.

## How to Customize

This template is designed for easy customization.

1.  **Edit the Main Page (`index.html`):**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * Find the `<div class="card-container">` section.
    * Each `<div class="card">` is a card.
    * Change the `href` in `<a href="page.html">` to point to your card redirection's page.
    * Change the card's title and description.

2.  **Create Your Project Pages:**
    * Copy one of the example project pages (e.g., `roadmap.html`) or create a new HTML file.
    * This new page is where you'll put all the details, images, and links for your specific project.

3.  **Edit Styles (Optional):**
    * In this setup, each page has it's own `.css`.
    * Feel free to edit and change as you need.
